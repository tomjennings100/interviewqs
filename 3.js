//You'll have already used (hopefully!) function.prototype.bind() today. Could you 
    //(1) tell me the difference between .bind() and .call()
    //(2) tell me the difference between .call() and .apply()
//You can talk this through with me or write it down, feel free to use code examples if it helps...
//If you take it home, please give examples of real life use cases.
